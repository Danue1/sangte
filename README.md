# sangte

Sangte is a state management library for React. This library is inspired by [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) and [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).

> Sangte means "state" in Korean.

## Installation

To install the library, run the following command:

```
npm install sangte
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```
yarn add sangte
```

## Why sangte over context?

- Less boilerplate
- Rerender only when the state you're using is updated

## Why sangte over Redux?

- Easy to use
- Allows multiple providers
- Creates hooks that you can easily pick the desired state or action functions.
